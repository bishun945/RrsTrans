Description: Transfer models to determine the above-water remote-sensing 
  reflectance from the underwater remote-sensing ratio. The package is an 
  appendix of our recent study entitled "A transfer model to determine the 
  above-water remote-sensing reflectance from the underwater remote-sensing 
  ratio" by Bi et al. (202x). Please refer to this paper for more details.
